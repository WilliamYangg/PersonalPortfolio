            I'm someone whos passionate about many things, but recently the
            development of AI has caught my attention so what better way to
            fully capture how scary AI is than to spend 33 dollars a month to
            buy a personal tutor who's available 24/7 except if you text them
            more than 50 messages in 3 hours, they'll stop replying to you.

        See, I love learning new things and meeting new people, it's like my
        alcohol to an alcoholic. The more people I meet, the larger the pot at
        the poker table, and the more things I learn, the more I realise how
        little I know.

        Thats enough waffling from me, how about you take a look at my projects
